project-2-19 created by GitHub Classroom

This is a build for team 2-19.  We have created an application for a micro-donation and volunteering app.
Please read through this brief overview of the features that can be used and what to look for as you browse our application.

First off, you will need to sign in with a a Google account to access the different features in our application.  
To do this, click the "Sign in or Register" button on the home page or view the top right of the navigation bar to sign in.

Once logged in, you should now be redirected to the home page and are able to view some of the most recent postings for donations and volunteering.
You should also be able to now see a profile as well.  If you have not created a profile yet, you will be directed to create one.
If a profile has already been created you will now be able to view and edit your profile and see all your previous postings as well as drafts.

If you head over to the Donations tab, you will be able to view posts.  You will be able to view other user's posts and also your own postings.
If you view other posts, you will be able to view the details and make a fake transaction with a fake PayPal account.
To proceed with this, click on the first PayPal link and you will be directed to another window to sign in.
Please sign in with the following fake PayPal credentials:
Username: personaluser1@gmail.com
Password: user12345
Once this is complete, you will be able to make the transaction and once you do this, you will see a notification appear on your screen.
To create your own posts, go to Create a Donation Cause and fill out a donation cause posting.
If you view your own post after creating one, you will be able to view our edit and even delete your own posts.  

The same steps for donations will apply for volunteering (without the PayPal integration).  

Once you are done viewing the system, you can logout.
